bun ios

# Run iOS app with specific configuration
bun ios:dev:release    # Dev release build
bun ios:beta           # Beta debug build
bun ios:release        # Release build

# Run Android app (development)
bun android

# Run Android app with specific variant
bun android:release    # Dev release build
bun android:build:release  # Dev release build
bun android:prod       # Production debug build

# Start Metro bundler (usually starts automatically)
bun start
```

### Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
bun run test

# Run tests for a specific file/pattern
bun run test path/to/test.ts

# Update snapshots
bun snapshots

# Type checking
bun typecheck

# Linting
bun lint
bun lint:fix

# Format code
bun format
```

### iOS-Specific Commands

```bash
# Interactive iOS build selector
bun ios:interactive

# Build iOS bundle for production
bun ios:bundle

# Update pods
bun pod:update
```

### Environment Setup

```bash
# Download environment variables (requires 1password CLI)
bun env:local:download

# Reset development environment
bun softreset    # Soft reset
bun hardreset    # Full reset including node_modules
```

## Architecture Overview

### State Management

The app uses **Redux with Redux-Saga** for state management:

- **Store**: Configured in `src/app/store.ts` with redux-persist using MMKV storage
- **Reducers**: Combined in `src/app/mobileReducer.ts` - includes both shared wallet reducers and mobile-specific reducers
- **Sagas**: Root saga in `src/app/saga.ts` orchestrates all side effects
- **Persistence**: State is persisted between sessions with migrations support

### Navigation Structure

React Navigation is used with the following stack structure:

- **AppStack**: Main app screens (HomeScreen, TokenDetailsScreen, etc.)
- **OnboardingStack**: New user onboarding flow
- **SettingsStack**: Settings hierarchy
- **FiatOnRampStack**: Fiat on-ramp flow (separate navigation tree)
- **UnitagStack**: Unitag-related screens

Navigation is configured in `src/app/navigation/navigation.tsx`.

### Feature Organization

Features are organized in `src/features/` with self-contained functionality:

- Each feature typically has its own slice, saga, and selectors
- Key features: wallet, CloudBackup, biometrics, walletConnect, notifications, deepLinking
- Features can have platform-specific implementations

### Screen Organization

Screens are in `src/screens/` organized by functionality:

- Main screens like HomeScreen have their own directories
- Related screens are grouped (e.g., all onboarding screens in Onboarding/)
- Modal screens use either React Navigation modals or custom modal system

### Native Modules

Platform-specific functionality is implemented via native modules:

- iOS: Swift modules in `ios/Uniswap/`
- Android: Kotlin/Java modules in `android/app/src/main/`
- Key modules: RNEthersRS (key management), RNCloudStorageBackupsManager, RNWalletConnect

### Shared Code

The app is part of a monorepo and shares code via packages:

- `wallet`: Core wallet functionality shared with extension
- `uniswap`: Shared utilities and constants
- `utilities`: Common utility functions

### Data Flow

1. User actions â†’ Redux actions
2. Reducers update state synchronously
3. Sagas handle async operations (API calls, native modules)
4. Apollo Client manages GraphQL data with cache
5. Components subscribe via hooks/selectors

## Development Tips

### Testing Approach

- Unit tests for utilities and reducers
- Integration tests for sagas using redux-saga-test-plan
- Component tests using React Native Testing Library
- E2E tests using Maestro (see docs/e2e-testing.md)

### Performance Considerations

- Heavy use of React.memo and useMemo for optimization
- FlashList used instead of FlatList for better performance
- Performance monitoring via Datadog integration

### Common Patterns

- Feature-based file organization
- Saga pattern for side effects
- Selectors for derived state
- Custom hooks for shared logic
- TypeScript for type safety throughout

### Debugging

- Reactotron support for development debugging
- Redux DevTools via Reactotron
- Native debugging via Xcode/Android Studio
- Performance profiling with React DevTools
